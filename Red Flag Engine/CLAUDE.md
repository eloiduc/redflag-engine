# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

This repository is newly initialized and does not yet contain source code, build configuration, or documentation. Update this file as the project takes shape.

# Workflow

Follow this process for every task:

1. **Think first** — read relevant files and understand the problem before writing any code.
2. **Write a plan** — create a checklist of steps in `tasks/todo.md` using `- [ ]` checkboxes.
3. **Check in** — present the plan to the user and wait for approval before starting.
4. **Work step by step** — complete one item at a time, marking each `- [x]` when done.
5. **Explain each change** — after each step, give a brief high-level summary of what changed and why.
6. **Stay minimal** — keep every change as small and focused as possible; avoid unrelated edits.
7. **Add a review section** — when all items are done, append a `## Review` section to `tasks/todo.md` summarising what was done.
